### Anthony DiFalco

# Visit https://di-falco.github.io/TicTacToe/ to play

* Simple Tic Tac Toe app that simply checks to see if the game is won.
* The game is won when any of the rows, columns, or diagonals are filled with the same value.
* Accepts any string as input, so instead of X and O you could use "Anthony" and "Scruffy" and still play as usual.
* Input is not case-sensitive. Win status updates as soon as the win condition is met.
